For Competitive player minimax algorithm has been used. It aims to minimize the possible loss for a worst-case scenario (hence "min") while assuming that the opponent will try to maximize their advantage (hence "max"). It traverses the game tree recursively to determine the best move. Also Alpha-Beta pruning is used to reduce the number of nodes evaluated in the search tree. It maintains two values, alpha and beta, which represent the minimum score that the maximizing player is assured of and the maximum score that the minimizing player is assured of, respectively. When a better solution is found (e.g., a higher score for the maximizing player or a lower score for the minimizing player), it prunes off the branches of the tree that cannot influence the final decision, thereby reducing the search space.
